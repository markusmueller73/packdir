# packdir
Small command line program to pack a file or directory. I use this small program to backup my files and dirs. I add it in batch or shell scripts and let them start from windows task scheduler or inside Linux as a cron job.

Use: packdir(.exe)
  to show a little help text.

Have fun, comments are welcome.
